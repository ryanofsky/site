My Home Page

Subversion repository: [https://russ.yanofsky.org/viewvc.py/site](https://russ.yanofsky.org/viewvc.py/site)

My home page, [russ.yanofsky.org](https://russ.yanofsky.org), implemented in
Python, backed by a Postgres database, and able to run either as a set of CGI
scripts or in a Mod_Python environment. Uses the EZT template engine (from
ViewVC), and an HTML widget framework I wrote based on the ones from my
[WCES](https://wces.russ.yanofsky.org/wces/) (PHP) and [Doctor
Database](https://doc.russ.yanofsky.org/) (Java) web apps.
